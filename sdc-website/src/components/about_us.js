                    <p>The Tennessee Tech Software Development Club was founded with the one key idea as its principal: that computer science students need more opportunities to shine and the community to grow.</p>
                    <p>We focus on being the catalyst for others to learn, meet new people, and ultimately, find a sense of place on campus.</p>
                    <p>Holding events regularly with new-technology competitions on the way, we strive to give a sense of comfort to those in want of opportunities for growth. </p>
                    <p>This club is not only a place to sharpen oneâ€™s skills and learn about different and exciting technologies, but it allows students to lay the foundations for successful careers out of college.</p>
